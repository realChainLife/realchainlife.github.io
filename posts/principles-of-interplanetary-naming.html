                                <p>Regardless of how you found yourself in the tech space, there’s ofcourse 
                                    many different ways to contribute to software development and yet 
                                    having a clear reason why you have chosen to learn to code will be very 
                                    important in how your entire journey pretty much plays out. 
                                </p>
                                <p>I started working with HTML/CSS like a lot of developers and two things I 
                                    quickly observed about the tech space is one - Software is everywhere, 
                                    making software development one of the most bankable skills; and secondly, 
                                    I noticed all the secondary skills I was developing as a result of starting 
                                    to code. These are skills that directly and indirectly compliment problem 
                                    solving which I was able to apply and bring my ideas to life.  On the flip 
                                    side, one of the challenges I had to contend with was the occasional feelings 
                                    of inadequacy as a result of the steep learning curve.
                                </p>
                                <p>If you have read through different developer stories, you will not be surprised 
                                    to learn that programmers, even those we admire, also faced these challenges 
                                    admitting to making a lot of mistakes and getting lost countless times when 
                                    learning a new language or working with multiple frameworks, libraries and 
                                    tools.
                                </p>
                                <p>Amazingly this is one of the really good things about experimenting with code. 
                                    Its that, if anyone applies patience, persistence and consistency in their 
                                    learning regiment they’ll most likely get to the hard part of learning to 
                                    code which for me was learning to apply the principles or components of 
                                    computational thinking in the way that I write and test code and the way I 
                                    look at efficient software development.  
                                </p>
                                <h2>Computational Thinking for Developers</h2>
                                <p>Computational thinking is a way of solving problems where a solution (of 
                                    which there may be many), can be executed by a computer. For developers, it 
                                    is the thought process that you run through even before you start writing 
                                    code. At a high-level each of its principles will guide your software design 
                                    and development from phase-to-phase until you've created a viable, real-world 
                                    solution to a problem.
                                </p>
                                <p>Whether you’re building a web-based solution, an iOS application, deploying 
                                    containers or even managing libraries, it’s generally recommended that you 
                                    apply these principles because combined they will enable you to determine how 
                                    good you are getting at writing and testing code.
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Decomposition</b></h3>
                                <p>To illustrate how each principle is applicable, note that developing and 
                                    delivering software products is a challenge that requires an understanding 
                                    of the variation of project sizes and complexities. With decomposition, as a 
                                    programmer you’ll be able to break down these complexities into smaller, more 
                                    manageable problems using exercises like user-story decomposition, code 
                                    decomposition and product release decomposition.
                                </p>
                                <p>By breaking down each project variation feature into simpler unit tasks, you’ll:</p>
                                <ul type="square">
                                    <li>Be able to make more regular progress towards your product release goals</li>
                                    <li>Get additional people involved with accomplishing the larger goal when 
                                        work is broken into isolated items done in parallel. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Avold analysis paralysis where without the constraints of smaller units 
                                        of tasks, complexity of discovering, understanding, validating and 
                                        implementing larger tasks will lead to overthinking, overdesigning and 
                                        accumulating work we may never need.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This process is a continual exercise from early feature ideas, to low-level 
                                    code changes and product-releases lead-times, decomposition makes this work 
                                    more manageable. The next time you review your use story, you’re in your 
                                    codebase or creating your release timeline, look out for the types of 
                                    decomposition you could use. 
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Pattern Recognition</b></h3>
                                <p>This is the mapping of similarities and differences among decomposed problems. 
                                    It helps with finding commonalities of repetition which is beneficial for 
                                    making predictions, working efficiently and building a strong foundation for 
                                    designing algorithms. As a developer you’ll apply pattern recognition 
                                    extensively to make connections between similar problems in large amounts of 
                                    data in an efficient way. 
                                </p>
                                <p>One way this can be reflected in your code is the use of a Nested For Loop to 
                                    allow rapid data sorting or insertion. Its logical structure provides a simple 
                                    way to cause sequential events to build upon each other and although its 
                                    processes vary between programming languages (Python, Java, JS), find examples 
                                    available that you can use to practise writing these scripts.
                                </p>
                                <p>There’s also multiple pattern recognition tools that are used for computation 
                                    of dissimilarities, feature extraction, cluster analysis and more. The most 
                                    common use cases of pattern recognition are in the design and development of 
                                    data analysis solutions, Natural Language Processing, document clarification 
                                    and facial recognition. 
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Abstraction</b></h3>
                                <p>Here it is recommended that every time you start writing code, you should 
                                    identify the complexity in your solution that users do not need to interact 
                                    with and “hiding” it within your code functions, interfaces, objects and 
                                    implementations in layers. This process is called abstraction and it 
                                    essentially splits one function into multiple interconnected functions.
                                </p>
                                <p>Applying abstraction skills is vital for developers working in collaborative 
                                    long term projects to ensure continuous expressiveness of the code you’re 
                                    writing. This is helpful when designing code, to determine which processes 
                                    happen when or where, or to identify the processes that depend on each other. 
                                    The identification of important information will enable you to leave out a 
                                    lot of unnecessary code, you’ll be able to write documentation and leave code 
                                    comments.
                                </p>
                                <p>All these different tasks will require you to be able to identify important 
                                    information to a user at any given time. It will also enable you to assist 
                                    the users get familiar with the product in the shortest time possible. As a 
                                    developer I have gone to certain documentation and the ones I found easiest 
                                    to use are from software and products that I’m still using to date which is 
                                    to say good abstraction goes a long way. 
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Algorithmic Thinking</b></h3>
                                <p>This is a combination of all the three elements we’ve covered so far. It 
                                    involves designing algorithms that can determine the appropriate steps to 
                                    take and organizing them into a series of instructions for solving a problem 
                                    correctly. Each algorithm typically has a starting point, a finishing point 
                                    and a set of well-defined instructions in between.
                                </p>
                                <p>A practical use case of algorithm design in code writing is with the 
                                    development of solutions that are increasingly used to automate software 
                                    development processes for efficient creation and deployment of the product. 
                                    For example with GitHub Actions, which is a product of algorithm design, 
                                    users can build simple workflows for code reviews, branch management and 
                                    issue tracking which will in turn level up the CI/CD pipeline.
                                </p>
                                <p>Being able to apply all these solutions within your code development and 
                                    developer journey will enable you to share your solutions with users quicker, 
                                    you’ll improve the quality of the softwares we bring to market.
