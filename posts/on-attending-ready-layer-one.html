                                <p>Between the 4th & 6th May, Ready Layer One brought together a wide range of engineers, companies 
                                    and users for the similarly named conference hosted on Hopin, a web based telecommunication service. 
                                    Through the three days conference, we attended several keynote talks, presentations and had the 
                                    opportunity to network with other like minded individuals. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The objective of the conference was to discuss Layer One Protocols, why they are crucial to the 
                                    adoption of blockchain and how distributed technologies can approach user experience. In this post 
                                    we will discuss some of the major themes covered throughout the conference. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Scaling & Evolution of Blockchains</h2>
                                <p>The scalability of distributed technology was a huge theme across several keynote talks and presentations 
                                    and rightly so. Until Layer One protocols can create scaling solutions that are viable to their 
                                    respective networks, any Layer Two solutions built on each will always face the challenge of 
                                    adoption. Some of these scaling challenges highlighted included:
                                </p>
                                <ul type="square">

                                    <li>Market-fit product research is still ongoing</li>
                                    <li>Web 3.0 technologies are in early research prototype stage</li>
                                    <li>Clear picture of mass adoption still lacking i.e. performance rate of networks
                                        with 100M daily users</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Several networks have taken various approaches to scaling their networks. While protocols like 
                                    OmiseGo take a generic approach where base layers remain unchanged and new implementations happen 
                                    on Layer Two, this doesn't address the need for the design of efficient base layers prior to 
                                    decentralized applications development.
                                </p>
                                <p>On network architectures with composability features built into their infrastructure, this scaling 
                                    solution can present as a lego block approach to building applications. This innovative design can 
                                    provide developers with tools to for example abstract backend and create time-interface applications 
                                    built to run on specific networks or write smart contracts capable of interchain communication. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Some evolution & scaling approaches such as sharding, although suitable for some networks, is not 
                                    without its challenges which might require multiple tests and review to understand infrastructure 
                                    design issues like backward compatibility to old & new smart contracts, role of validators & token 
                                    holders and finally pricing or fees based on new network bandwidths. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Privacy-Centric Networks</h2>
                                <p>Anonymous communication has long been a staple of peer-to-peer technology evidenced by the adoption 
                                    of technologies like TCP/IP, UDP and Libp2p. For engineers of Layer One protocols and/or solutions 
                                    its crucial that they don't get privacy wrong. For VPNs, for example, altough traffic entry/end points 
                                    are protected via randomized routing/hoping, timing and packet sizes available in metadata can be 
                                    used to deanonymize traffic.
                                </p>
                                <p>For Layer One Protocols secure enclaves like Intel, SGX and Keystone have been used to build trusted 
                                    smart contract environments or untraceable sphinx mixnets. Using Elliptic Curve multiplication and 
                                    randomized packet automation network developers can create solutions that anonymize user traffic. 
                                    On other networks we've seen interesting approaches to building privacy preserving data sharing 
                                    applications that include the use of:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>privacy preserving analytics and machine learning to curb data leakages</li>
                                    <li>confidentiality preserving smart contracts incase of untrustworthy applications, or</li>
                                    <li>scalable smart contract execution within trusted open framework architectures.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Although Layer One networks are keen on addressing issues around scaling, network security, valuation 
                                    and adoption; how they address the issue of user traffic & transaction privacy as they grow their user 
                                    base will continue to be closely examined.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Professional Grade DevTools</h2>
                                <p>For us to truly usher in the next wave of the decentralized web, one that promises secure self publishing,
                                    secure communication, secure data storage & more, as ecosystem stakeholders its crucial that we address 
                                    how professional grade developer tooling can raise the tide of protocol development. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Efficiently developed, professional devtools support design, implementation and execution of networks. At 
                                    this conference we presented several such tools which would be ideal for consideration by any protocol 
                                    engineer. They include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Truffle Suite:</b> This suite has been designed to work for beginners, intermediates 
                                        & expert developers. It also proves supports for different development environments like iOS, 
                                        Windows, Linux distros & browser. It has also been designed to support multiple blockchain 
                                        networks. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Libp2p:</b> Adopted by several networks including IPFS, 0x, ETH, Polkadot & Cosmos
                                        It provides secure communication channels with handshake implementations. It also runs gossipub 
                                        extensions on pubsub and along with its Kademlia DHT improvements its an ideal developer tool.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Filecoin:</b> As a proof of storage solution, it provides 1 EB storage ideal for the 
                                        development of solutions addressing storage & distribution of user data, hosting of large data 
                                        smart contracts, storing & distributing packages, containers, CDN Contents and more. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>DevTools designed to work for all developers, all operating systerms, all blockchain networks will contribute 
                                    greatly to the design, development and adoption of more Layer One solutions & consequently increase 
                                    decentralized applications development and adoption.
                                </p>
                                <h2>Accrued Network Valuations</h2>
                                <p>Unlike centralized systems that have pre-set methods to determing network value, as decentralized systems 
                                    participants we are yet to create a network valuation metric that captures the distributed nature of the 
                                    systems we are building. To measure accrued network value, some of the factors that we can consider are: 
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>For Tokenholders:</b></h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Would a reduction of token supply increase community contribution? So 
                                        far, token issuance has not retained value captured eg during the 2017 ICO boom. It can also be 
                                        argued that networks with cryptoassets independent of protocol developments are also place higher 
                                        than the their counterparts. 
                                    </li>  
                                </ul>

                                <h4><b>For Investors:</b></h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Investors in decentralized networks have the unique opportunity to determine 
                                        a protocol's value from early/seed stage to latter investments stages. With access to development 
                                        milestones & targets, they can determine whether incremental development equals higher network 
                                        valuations.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4><b>Validators/Developers:</b></h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>As the backbone of any distributed system, we're yet to determine 
                                        how much the democratic nature of running nodes, the total number of validators and developers 
                                        contributes to a networks accrued value.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                               
                                <p>Other factors that were mentioned as critical to determine the real value of a network include smart contract 
                                    execution, the class of applications that can work within that system, network security, network performance 
                                    and other abstraction layers. It seems then, it will take more time until an industry standard has been 
                                    tested, implemented and agreed on by consensus. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>Due to the ongoing global health crisis and its disruption of services like the organization of conferences, 
                                    seminars and workshops I was skeptical about the success of such an ambitious taking by Ready Layer One. 
                                    Fortunately, it became abundatly clear that the organizers hit a jackpot as I and hundreds more joined the 
                                    platform for the first session. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The interactive chat feature in every session was a personal favorite. I'm certain it contributed to the 
                                    the user experience and overall success of the event. Since we could only attend one session at a time, I'll 
                                    be writing a follow-up piece once I've had the opportunityto watch the remaining sessions. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Did you attend RL1? Let me know your favourite session and theme.</p>
