                                <p>Since the eruption of blockchain technology as a potential disruptive force to traditional 
                                    business models, we have witnessed the adoption of this technology in the overhaul of existing
                                    applications to transform business and service delivery. The sports industry has not be 
                                    left behind in the blockchain technology revolution.
                                </p>
                                <p> In the last few years we have seen an increase in the incorporation of blockchain and IoT 
                                    devices to traditional sports sectors like betting, anti-doping, fans-engagements and cultivation 
                                    and utilization of big data. In this post, I'll cover my newest project <b><a href="https://playmakerchain.com/">PlayMaker Chain</a></b> 
                                    and how we will incoroprate both IoT and blockchain to revolutionize the sports industry. 
                                </p>
                                <h2>What is PlayMaker Chain?</h2>
                                <figure data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="60" class="w-richtext-align-center" 
                                    style="max-width: 60%;" data-rt-max-height="33.75">
                                    <div><img src="/blog-img/playmaker.png" alt=""></div>
                                    <figcaption>PlayMaker Chain</figcaption>
                                </figure>
                                <p>PlayMaker is one of the several clone cryptocurrencies that stemmed from VechainThor. PlayMaker 
                                    “forked” off the VechainThor ledger in late 2018. Its a blockchain system optimized for sports 
                                    science and related businesses.
                                </p>
                                <p>The PlayMaker vision is to be a complement to VechainThor the silver to Thor’s gold. Instead of 
                                    the approximately 10,000 transactions per second on the Thor network, the PlayMaker blockchain 
                                    will handle up to 15,000 transactions per second instead. 
                                </p>
                                <p>While making transactions almost twice as fast, PlayMaker also modified the maximum number of coins 
                                    that can be mined ensuring we stay committed to building a trustworthy decentralized business solution 
                                    with a transparent information flow, collaboration, effectiveness and value high-speed transmission.
                                </p>
                                <h2>How It Works</h2>
                                <p>As it stands, sports and transparency are not synonyms. Over time we have witnessed multiple lawsuits 
                                    based around the unsavory practices in sponsorship contracts, transfers and tax evasions. The PlayMaker 
                                    solutions are intended to enable various entities in sports to function in the most secure, transparent 
                                    and fan-friendly way by specializing in supply chain management, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 
                                    anti-counterfeiting. 
                                </p>
                                <p>By incorporating the PlayMaker network platforms into their infrastructures, users (corporations and 
                                    individuals) will access the PlayMaker tokens that will be used to perform transactions. As it will be 
                                    optimized to apply IoT technology all products and services will be tracked throughout the distribution 
                                    process using network generated private keys. The distributed data storage characteristics of the PlayMaker 
                                    blockchain network will be the key to improving traceability and transparency throughout the supply chain 
                                    management.
                                </p>
                                <p>The PlayMaker blockchain network can be summarized into these characteristics on which its reputation 
                                    is built:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Transactions are processed directly from peer to peer with fewer intermediaries, they will 
                                        also be immutable and irrevocable. All transactions are also visible to authorized participants 
                                        and traceable within the network ledgers.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Both sides of the transactions are executed simultaneously as all ledgers are automatically 
                                        updated. This limits how much time goes into the reconciliation work required.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Resources used to validate transactions on the PlayMaker network are mainly computing power, 
                                        combined with running on the proof-of-authority algorithm will cost less than traditional man 
                                        power. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Ours is an open-source technology, contributors interested in building a resilient network 
                                        that does not have any single point of failure are always welcome to the team. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <h4><b>Consensus Algorithm</b></h4>
                                <p>The proof-of-authority consensus model is optimized for system continuity while requiring low 
                                    computational power yet has no requirement for communication between nodes to reach consensus. Without 
                                    the computational competition, associated with PoW, PoS and DpoS, Authority Masternodes will have an 
                                    equal opportunity to produce and validate blocks. Since users will be required to reveal their identity 
                                    voluntarily prior to setting up an Authority Masternode on the PlayMaker blockchain. 
                                </p>
                                <p>It is expected that they will work in favor of the network growth and security when their identity and 
                                    reputation are at stake. Essentially, the network will provide a balance between total centralization and 
                                    total decentralization as a compromise to both worlds. This ensures that the system can perform multiple 
                                    rounds of inter-code communications to get consensus. 
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>Network Architecture</b></h4>
                                <p>The blockchain and IoT fusion can and will be the formidable transformative technology that will underline 
                                    the efficiency and innovation that will make up the baseline for the PlayMaker Network. For the concept to 
                                    work, an entire infrastructure is deployed covering everything between the sensors, the network integration 
                                    and augmented behavior. 
                                </p>
                                <p>The PlayMaker Information loop covers four layers:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><b>Sensors:</b> These sensors, RFID and/or NFC chips, attached to people or things generate the 
                                        data and trigger the flow of information. This layer will integrate a system that takes automated 
                                        instructions from upstream and execute an action.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Network:</b> Using a series of hardware, software and messaging protocols, the PlayMaker networking 
                                        equipment will communicate data from the sensor and connect it to the internet and the Blockchain.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Standards and Protocols:</b> As the core of the architecture, the standards of the PlayMaker protocol 
                                        will manage the sensor and network elements; combined with smart contracts capabilities, raw data 
                                        (transactions) are taken from downstream, analyzed and used for deriving actionable insights. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Intelligence & Behavior:</b> Post analytics, information derived from the IoT data is used to build 
                                        applications and other services on the PlayMaker blockchain infrastructure.
                                    </li>

                                <h4><b>Token & Node Economics</b></h4>
                                <p>The PlayMaker economy consists of two coins. This is done to minimize the direct effects of the PMK token 
                                    price actions on the network fees for users of the blockchain. For our enterprises and institutional users 
                                    this guarantees a stable transaction fee, something that is currently not possible in for example other 
                                    projects.
                                </p>
                                <p><b>PlayMaker Token (PMK)</b></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Use Case:</b> Store of Value and smart payment currency</li>
                                    <li><b>How To Get:</b> PMK is currently not available on the open market. Strategic partners can buy 
                                        from a dedicated pool when the network is launched. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><b>Use Case:</b> Needed to interact with the blockchain for certain operations, like executing smart 
                                        contracts, writing data to the blockchain and transferring tokens.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>How To Get:</b> Users will generate Thor when owning PMK.</li>

                                <p>Using our traceable wallet, users can apply that wallet to become a Node. There are various types of nodes, 
                                    which all have different benefits, functions, and requirements.
                                </p>
                                <p>The nodes can be divided into two types:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><b>Authority Nodes:</b> The authority nodes are used to validate all blockchain transactions. Authority 
                                        nodes have the highest requirements, but also gives you access to the biggest benefits. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Economy Nodes:</b> The economic nodes are not validating blockchain transactions, but offer stability 
                                        to the ecosystem and Provide benefits compared to non-Node owners. To get an economic node, a certain amount 
                                        of PMK has to be placed in your PlayMaker mobile wallet. When users meet the minimum amount of PMK they can 
                                        join the Node program by going to the Rewards tab in the mobile wallet.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
