                                <p>The internet is the largest computer network in the world, today we use it across the 
                                    globe to collect, transfer and process information through forms as diverse as data 
                                    server warehouses, in-hand mobile devices or other connected devices. Due to its 
                                    constantly changing size and shape, we are faced with issues around cyber attacks, 
                                    database vulnerabilities and hardware defenses.
                                </p>
                                <p>Traditionally, system maintainers used static cyber firewalls around a network perimeter 
                                    to patch any discovered holes. This method is not without its demerits, evident in 
                                    the great number of hacks, data leaks and privacy violations witnessed over the last 
                                    couple decades. In this post we will review the new approaches that rely on knowing 
                                    the cyber terrain within decentralized & distributed networks that form part of Web3.0.
                                </p>
                                <p>We'll dive deep into distributed data structures and cover the various security aspects 
                                    of distributed networks that are crucial for effective cyber security standards 
                                    implementation. These include (i) cryptographic key management, (ii) privacy protection 
                                    mechanisms, (iii) critical infrastructure security and (iv) predictive cyber protection. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Cryptographic Key Management</h3>
                                <p>The ideal architecture of modern cyber security is one built on the foundations of Trusted 
                                    Computing and Zero Trust combined to provide high-quality data security. In this model, 
                                    algorithmic controls are applied and verification performed ensuring data privacy and 
                                    confidentiality that makes it simpler for users to operate. These architectural 
                                    components include:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>Key management:</b> This is an essential component of a cryptographic access 
                                            control system within a distributed or decentralized network. It manages the 
                                            secret keys assigned to network entities in such a way that only authorized 
                                            users can access particular resources.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The important objective of key management in a network with multiple nodes is 
                                            to restrict access of confidential data to authorized users verified using each 
                                            nodes key. Cryptographic algorithms are continually being improved to perfect 
                                            functions like granting/revoking access, data restructuring in case of user/node 
                                            revocation or deletion.
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p><b>Key Tampering:</b> While strides have been made to ensure consensus algorithms 
                                            are resilient to real world attacks, protocol architects need to constantly design 
                                            new implementation models of cryptographic schemes that can capture potential 
                                            attacks for example the deployment of encryption in detecting and deterring 
                                            tampering attacks. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>The <a href="https://www.futurex.com/solutions/hardened-enterprise-security-platform/">
                                            <b>Hardened Enterprise Security Platform</b></a> for example deploys a security 
                                            encryption framework that's designed to comprehensively secure aspects and node 
                                            endpoints of a networks' core cyptographic infrastructure, key management, secure 
                                            data storage and more. 
                                        </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Networks that are incoporating these architecural features include Bitcoin, IPFS, and 
                                    other major blockchain networks. You can read more about this topic in my previous 
                                    article <a href="/blog/posts/cryptographic-key-management.html"><b>Cryptographic Key 
                                    Management</b></a> and learn about ways you can implement these solutions in your 
                                    network or personal use.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Privacy Protection Mechanisms</h3>
                                <p>Although we have briefly covered key management and its privacy enhancing qualities, 
                                    networks like the Hyperledger Fabric developed more frameworks such as certificate 
                                    authority, channels and Private Data Collection to improve the privacy protection 
                                    mechanisms. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Explored further, the privacy proctection frameworks of the Fabric Network comprise 
                                    of the following aspects:
                                </p>
                                <ol type="i">
                                    <li>asymmetric cryptography to separate transaction data from on-chain records.</li>
                                    <li>digital certificate management service. </li>
                                    <li>multi-channels that separates information between different channels.</li>
                                    <li>privacy data collection further satisfies the need for the isolation of 
                                        privacy data between different organizations within the same channel.
                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                <p>In all distributed networks, these frameworks produce data that is tamper-proof, 
                                    traceable and trustworthy. This nature of the technology is expected to be the 
                                    cornerstone of  Web 3.0. Yet despite these underlying capabilities, cyber security 
                                    standards and controls must be followed within other technical infrastructure linked 
                                    to the distributed network to protect them from outside attacks.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Critical Infrastructure Security</h3>
                                <p>The adoption rate of serverless infrastructure has been on the increase in recent years 
                                    and to date, billions have been and continue to be invested in the development and 
                                    support of these infrastructure. Given that serverless computing is a relatively new 
                                    technology, its unique security risks have been a challenge to understand and manage.
                                </p>
                                <ul type="square">
                                    <li><b>Software vulnerabilities:</b> Since this technology started shipping in 
                                        millions of devices globally, standards have been created and solutions are 
                                        emerging to tackle cyber attacks that target critical consumer and business 
                                        physical systems, such as smart connected devices. Unlike centralized networks 
                                        which are vulnerable to DoS & DDos attacks, distributed networks are prone to 
                                        scalability and code vulnerability attacks that result in extensive financial 
                                        burdens.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>Hardware vulnerabilities:</b> In spite of the increasing sophistication of 
                                        software attacks, distributed networks like Bitcoin have to contend with evolving 
                                        hardware vulnerabilities through unsafe hardware architecture which can be used 
                                        to extract private keys or complex production processes that could result in 
                                        disgruntled or malicious chip designers implanting malicious logic or circuits 
                                        without being noticed.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Some of the measures network maintainers can take to mitigate risks associated with 
                                    database changes, code modifications and cloud storage events include the performance 
                                    of regular code audits to address exploitable security vulnerabilities, using CI/CD 
                                    to mitigate bugs or code vulnerabilities and leveraging tools to increase visibility 
                                    and efficiency of attack indicators. You can read more about security-first architecture

                                <h3>Predictive Cyber Protection</h3>
                                <p>The evolving complex nature of cyber attacks on distributed networks has called for 
                                    development of predictive cyber defense beyond baking hack resistance directly into 
                                    hardware. Several solutions implemented on various networks automatically generate, 
                                    deploy and manage secure configurations of components and sub protocols for use in 
                                    these networks.
                                </p>
                                <p>Machine learning solutions and AI tools are also used to develop integrated systems, 
                                    to transform data to signals, relevant to predicting network attacks. Although its 
                                    yet to be seen which solutions will stand out in this industry, it can be argued that 
                                    careful implementation of other cyber security components, like key management, 
                                    privacy protection mechanisms and infrastructure security, on any distributed network 
                                    will minimize system vulnerabilities.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                                <p>The Integration of Trusted Computing standards, such as decentralized DNS systems or 
                                    distributed nodes, to guide users, processes or technology has produced system neutral 
                                    solutions that address the challenge of distributed security. These are the key points 
                                    to consider while developing an effective cyber security strategy for a distributed or 
                                    decentralized web.
