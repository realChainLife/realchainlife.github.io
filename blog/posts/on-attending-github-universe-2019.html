                                <p>Between 13th & 14th November I attended and participated in a panel at Github Universe 2019. If you are 
                                    a frequent reader you'll know that, for the most part, alot of my blog covers the technicalities and 
                                    mechanics of decentralized & distributed systems.  
                                </p>
                                <p>Occassionally, however, I have writen about past conferences, events I've attended, and trainings I've 
                                    participated in or conducted. In today's post I want to hightlight some of my experience at this year's 
                                    Github Universe starting with some of the highlights from the Keynote speeches. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Keynote Announcements</h3>
                                <p>For the two days of the Github conference we attended two keynote sessions where Github team members, one 
                                    after the other, presented the newest features and updates coming to Github in 2020. Among the features 
                                    announced these are the ones I'm keen on interacting with:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><a href="https://github.com/mobile/"><b>Github Mobile:</b></a> Github for Mobile is a service we've 
                                        long been looking forward to, coming with a dark mode option, its set up to be a great tool for developers 
                                        on-the-go. Its my favorite feature because of <b><i>its potential impact for developers and creators 
                                        working in Africa</i></b>. Enjoying an ever-growing increase in new mobile connections every year, 
                                        its safe to believe more developers on the continent, will be able to access various products and services 
                                        through this solution. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://github.com/features/actions"><b>Github Actions:</b></a> Actions is a new Github feature 
                                        which makes it easy to automate all software workflows with world-class CI/CD. Users can build, test, and 
                                        deploy code right from GitHub, make code reviews, manage branches and more. An automated workflow comes 
                                        with a built-in continuous integrationn service which will ensure continuous integration (CI) and continuous 
                                        deployment (CD). 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://github.com/sponsors"><b>Github Sponsors:</b></a> This is the newest way to contribute on 
                                        Github. With Sponsors, any GitHub user can sponsor any open source developer or organization in the program. 
                                        Funding developers and organizations through GitHub Sponsors is one more way to contribute to open source 
                                        projects you appreciate. Help projects get the resources they need, and recognize contributors working behind 
                                        the scenes to make open source better for everyone. 
                                    </li>
                                    <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzI9FNjXQ0o"><b>Arctic Code Vault:</b></a> GitHub will be storing 
                                        the planet's open-source software in the frozen Arctic for 1,000 years. The Arctic Code Vault as its known, 
                                        is a data repository preserved in a very-long-term archival facility. GitHub will take a snapshot of all public 
                                        code repositories, save it on film, and archive it 250 meters deep in the permafrost of an Arctic mountain. 
                                        This project ensures data remains usable in a future world that may not have machines or knowledge to read it.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Adoption of Github mobile should result in an increase in technological solutions coming out of Africa, combined with 
                                    utilization of Github Sponsors young developers and software creators will pursue software development as the viable 
                                    tool to build the right technlogical solutions for the continent. 
                                </p>
                                <p>Besides the above, I'd also like to highlight the <b><i>Notifications</i></b> & <b><i>Search</i></b> functions expected 
                                    updates. According to the two presentations, Notifications will offer a clean user experience which labels all incoming
                                    notifications based on type for example <i>code review requests</i> or <i>mentions</i>. The Code Search function will 
                                    also be updated to offer higher search accuracy in turn lowering the number of search results and cutting down time 
                                    spent during a <i>code search</i>.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Open Source in Africa Panel</h3>
                                <h4><b>Panel Session</b></h4>
                                <p>At our panel session dubbed, <b>"Open Source in Africa"</b> I joined other panelists from various organizations and countries 
                                    across africa to bring to Github the outlook for open source in Africa. As open source community players in our different 
                                    industries, we came together to discuss the unique industry trends, seek new collaborators and highlight the adoption 
                                    possibilities currently available for government institutions, corporations and organizations. 
                                </p>

                                </figure>
                                <p>Other topics we explored included a push for use of FOSS in governments and institutions. How prorietary companies can also 
                                    be encouraged to make more contribution to the open source industry on the continent. The inclusion of a Africa centric panel 
                                    at this year's conference is a step towards embracing the continent and I'm keen to see how Github will move to improve its 
                                    relationship with developers and creators. 
                                </p>
                                <h4><b>Contributors Interview & Photoshoot Sessions</b></h4>
                                <p>At the conference I was also selected to one of the interviewees for a new Github magazine featuring open source projects 
                                    contributors and maintainers. I answered questions about my journey into open source, maintainers I admire and expound on my "Knowing 
                                    is not enough we must do". Several speakers also enjoyed a personalised photoshoot, which could easily have been my favourite session 
                                    during the conference. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Panels, Talks & Sponsor Booths</h3>
                                <p>Besides the keynote sessions announcements, I attended other sessions that also drew my interest. I particularly enjoyed 
                                    the: (i) "Good code documents itself" and other lies: Changing work culture through 
                                    documentation session by Tania Allard, (ii) The code behind cars: How GitHub turned Ford into a software company session 
                                    with Tim Carmean & Tom Erickson and (iii) Embracing open source in risk-averse organizations panel
                                </p>
                                <p>At the conference I visited several booths presenting the various solutions for programmers. Among the booths i visited was the 
                                    DaTree booth which presented a tool to enforce your development best practices, coding standards, and security policies on every 
                                    commit. I also visited 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Mild Protests & Universe 2020</h3>
                                <p>The conference also welcomed mild protests various individuals and group who raised several issues with a policy the Github 
                                    organisation did not address during the conference. The presence of the protesters however didn't dampen the atmosphere as attendees,
                                    maintainers, Githubbers and a flurry of people attended sessions, gave interviews shared meals and networked as i expected. 
                                </p>
                                <p>ALthough this was my first Github Universe conderence i look forward to attending and participating at future guthub unoverse conferences 
                                    to stay upto date on the development of open source and collaborative work across the world but especially in africa. 
                                </p>
